Answer – Effect of Hidden Layer Size

When the number of hidden nodes increases:
- With very few hidden nodes (1–2), the model is underfitting. It cannot capture the complex patterns in the dataset, so the accuracy is low.
- With a moderate number of hidden nodes (3–20), the model has enough capacity to learn the non-linear decision boundary. The accuracy improves significantly because the model can represent more complex features.
- With a very large number of hidden nodes (50 or more), the model becomes more expressive, but it may start to overfit the training data. Accuracy on training may remain high, but test/generalization accuracy can fluctuate or plateau.

Pattern of accuracy:
- Accuracy increases as we add more hidden nodes, up to a point.
- After reaching a good hidden size (e.g., around 5–20 in this task), adding more nodes gives diminishing returns and may introduce instability due to overfitting or noisy decision boundaries.

In summary, increasing hidden nodes improves accuracy initially, but after a certain threshold, the improvement slows down or may even degrade due to overfitting.
